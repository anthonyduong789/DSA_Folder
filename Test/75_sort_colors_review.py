"""
one thing we know is that for the left numbers its always going to be zero
right part of the array is always going to be 2




- we can have the problem where we have a left pointer that points 
the far most left value that isn't 
zero each time you have a new zero swap and increment

keep track of 1 and 2 and have the rest of the value filled up with 2
make it where we automatically shuffle 1 value to the left if value
