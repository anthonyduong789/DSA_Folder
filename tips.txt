When to use a dsa




Example of depth-first-search


graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}

def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()

    print(start)
    visited.add(start)

    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)


dfs(graph, 'A')



from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])

    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        if vertex not in visited:
            print(vertex)
            visited.add(vertex)
            queue.extend([neighbor for neighbor in graph[vertex] if neighbor not in visited])

bfs(graph, 'A')


# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def maxDepth(self, root):
        """
        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :rtype: int
        """
        self.maxDepthAmount = 0
        def search(root):
            if not root:
                return 0
            left = search(root.left)
            right = search(root.right)
            
            currentMostDepthAtNode = max(left, right) + 1

            maxDepthAmount = max(maxDepthAmount, currentMostDepthAtNode)
            #add plus one for current level at 
            return currentMostDepthAtNode
        search(root)

        return maxDepthAmount

^^ above would be right usin self self.maxDepthAmount 
for all them

Feature | Local Variable | self Variable
Scope | Only inside one function | Across all methods in the class
Persists after method? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes
Shared across calls? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes
Can be used in nested functions? | ❌ Needs nonlocal | ✅ Works fine as is
